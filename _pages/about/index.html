Feel free to peruse the site for various insight into my endeavors in mathematics or photos of my dog :)</p> <p>Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate at Brown University studying mathematics with a broad range of interests in topology, metric geometry, and algebraic combinatorics. Outside of standing in front of blackboard covered in chalk, I love to read books, play the piano, watch various action/thriller TV shows, and explore new restaurants in Providence and Boston.</p> <p>email: natsuka [underline] hayashida [at] brown.edu</p> </body></html>
