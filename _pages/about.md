Welcome to my page! Feel free to peruse the site for various insight into my endeavors in mathematics or photos of my dog :)

I'm currently an undergraduate at Brown University studying mathematics with a broad range of interests in topology, metric geometry, and algebraic combinatorics. Outside of standing in front of blackboard covered in chalk, I love to read books, play the piano, watch various action/thriller TV shows, and explore new restaurants in Providence and Boston.
