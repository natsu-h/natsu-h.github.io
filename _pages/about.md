Welcome to my page! Feel free to peruse the site for various insight into my endeavors in mathematics or photos of my dog :)
I'm currently an undergraduate at Brown University studying mathematics with a broad range of interests in topology, metric geometry, and algebraic combinatorics. Outside of standing in front of blackboard covered in chalk, I love to read books, play the piano, watch various action/thriller TV shows, and explore new restaurants in Providence and Boston.

#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
